### Data Science Projects.

[Project 1: Fake News Detection using Machine Learning](https://github.com/dpendhakal/ThinkStats2/tree/master/book)

The project was to investigate and check the performances of five different models (Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Passive Aggressive Classifier Algorithm, Support Vector Classification, Decision Tree Classification) on the dataset containing 7796 news articles labelled as ‘Fake’ and ‘Real’. 



---
[Project 2: Customer Segmentation](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)

The purpose of the project was to identify the different customer segments to focus on for profit maximization.


---
[Project 3: Movie Recommender System.](http://example.com/)

The purpose of the project was to create a movie recommending system using content based filtering and collaborative filtering.


---
[Project 4: Data Presentation and Visualization.](http://example.com/)

Worked on 5 small data visualization projects with the given scenario and data. Preprocessed data for analysis, performed exploratory data analysis, transformations, and summary statistics. Created dashboard using PowerBI and Tableau outlining the facts, stats, and the trends. Prepared an executive summary summarizing the findings and telling the story of what was found using PowerPoint. Designed media campaigns for external audiences: blog post, infographic, and a short video clip.

---
[Project 5: Predicting Credit Card Fraud](http://example.com/)

Identified the right source of data and gained insights through Exploratory Data Analysis. Selected appropriate models and model specifications and applied the respective methods to enhance data-driven decision making related to the business problem. Presented intermediate results of the project for evaluation to discuss the issues, challenges encountered during the work, and plans to complete the analysis.

---
[Project 6: Data Mining Project ](http://example.com/)

Worked with the King County Housing Prices data sourced from Kaggle. Preformed graphical analysis explained/analyzed the information provided by each graph. Dropped any features that are not useful for the model building, addressed missing data issues, built new features needed for the model. Built and evaluated the most appropriate model. Accuracy Score, AUC ROC, and Cross Validation are the metrics used for model evaluation. Performed hyperparameter tuning of the Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) model.


---
[Project 7: Data Wrangling Project](http://example.com/)

Worked on the English Premier League data for season 2020/2021. Identified three data sources (CSV/Excel/PDF, JSON file, and API). Performed data transformations, formatted data into readable format, identified outliers and bad data, dealt with missing values and duplicates, fixed casing, or inconsistent values, and conducted Fuzzy Matching. Loaded each dataset into SQLite as an individual table and then joined dataset together in Python into single dataset. Created different visualization of the merged data using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Power BI.


---
[Project 8: Exploratory Data Analysis](http://example.com/)

Performed exploratory data analysis, transformations, and summary statistics on World Happiness survey data via both R and Python. Preprocessed data for analysis. Handled missing values, data anomalies & special characters and prepared insightful visualization and descriptive statistics. Compared different scenarios using PMF, created CDF for the variables used. Formulated hypothesis, analyzed data, summarized the findings, and presented the results among peers.
